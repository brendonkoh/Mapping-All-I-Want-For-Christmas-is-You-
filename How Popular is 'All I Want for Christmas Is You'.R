#Checking to see if there are any regions that we have data for that didn't have All I Want for Christmas Is You break the Top 200 Charts in Nov-Dec 2020
setdiff(unique(chartdata$region), unique(mariah$region))

#Let's see what's going on with S.Korea and Andorra
skorea <- chartdata %>% filter(region == "South Korea")
head(skorea)
skorea %>% filter(as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d") < "2021-01-01") # no results

#Andorra
andorra <- chartdata %>% filter(region == "Andorra")
head(andorra)
andorra %>% filter(chart == "top200") #no results

#S. Korea doesn't have data prior to 2021. Andorra only has data for Viral 50 Charts, not Top 200.
#This means that for every country spotify had top200 data for in nov-dec 2020, mariah appeared on the top 200 charts at least once. In other words, any missing region from the dataset is because there was no chart data collected (or scraped) for these areas.

#We can fix that by filling in values based on the regions we have data on. For dates when a region has no data recorded, their rank is coded as "Not in the Top 200 Charts" rather than being missing from the data. This is because the missingness is caused by the song not being in the top 200 chart rather than there being no data collected for the region.
