# Mapping Mariah Carey's <i>All I Want for Christmas Is You</i>
An interactive animated map tracking the popularity of Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas is You" on Spotify from November to December 2020 across the world. You can move around the map and hover over each country for more information. This visualisation was created as part of a workshop I led on creating interactive maps for the UCL Data Visualisation Society.

Here's a recording of the animated map. You can find the full interactive map <a href = " " target = "_blank">here</a>.

The Spotify Chart data used was obtained from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts?select=charts.csv">Kaggle</a> while the ISO-3166 country codes used to plot the map was obtained from the ISO website (I have uploaded a .csv file that contains all the country codes). The map was created in R using the 'plotly' package.
