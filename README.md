# Mapping-All-I-Want-For-Christmas-is-You-
An interactive animated map tracking the popularity of Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas is You" on Spotify from November to December 2020 across the world. You can move around the map and hover over each country for more information. This visualisation was created as part of a workshop I led for the UCL Data Visualisation Society on creating interactive maps.

The dataset used was obtained from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts?select=charts.csv">Kaggle</a>. The ISO-3166 country codes used to plot the map was obtained from the ISO website and I have uploaded a .csv file of all country codes (retrieved on 29 Dec 2022).

The full explanation of the data cleaning and visualisation process can be found <a href = "https://brendonkoh-portfolio.netlify.app/projects/how-popular-is-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you/">here</a>.
